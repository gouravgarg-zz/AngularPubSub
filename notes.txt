In java script object behave like objects / array depend on requirments 
var a= {"b":20}
a.b = 20 (with dot notation)
we can also use string notaion to fetch value


If we want to use data binding between multiple controller we need to use  publisher and subscriber 
pattern, for the same we on $broadcaster and $on methods for the same 


use ng-change to change value in local storage
$$hashkey is numberic : from angular it self, it's  object value to check values has been changed or not


ng click vs ng changed
click will update (angular model and database / custom logic  ) or (database / custom logic and angular model and   ),
so there can be a race conditions so always use change event it always use angular and cusome logic. 

multiple ref 

hash key value
