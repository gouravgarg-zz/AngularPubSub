In java script object behave like objects / array depend on requirments 
var a= {"b":20}
a.b = 20 (with dot notation)
we can also use string notaion to fetch value


If we want to use data binding between multiple controller we need to use  publisher and subscriber 
pattern, for the same we on $broadcaster and $on methods for the same
